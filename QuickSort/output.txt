Before quicksort: [ 15, 28, 5, 12, 27 ]
. Calling partition [ 15, 28, 5, 12, 27 ] with leftBound 0 and rightBound 4
.. Partitioning with pivot 5 leftIndex 0 rightIndex 4
.. 27 > 5 : Decremented rightIndex => 3
.. 12 > 5 : Decremented rightIndex => 2
.. 0 <= 2 : Swapped leftIndex 0 with rightIndex 2 [ 5, 28, 15, 12, 27 ]
......... : Incremented leftIndex => 1 Decremented rightIndex => 1
.. 28 > 5 : Decremented rightIndex => 0
. Returning pivotIndex = 1

Calling quicksort for left partition with leftBound 0 and (pivotIndex-1) 0

Calling quicksort for right partition with pivotIndex 1 and rightBound 4
. Calling partition [ 5, 28, 15, 12, 27 ] with leftBound 1 and rightBound 4
.. Partitioning with pivot 15 leftIndex 1 rightIndex 4
.. 27 > 15 : Decremented rightIndex => 3
